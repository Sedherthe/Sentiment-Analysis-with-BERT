# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Sentiment Analysis using the Huggingface transformers' BERT Model. A short and well taught guided project on Coursera. Interested ones can find the project [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/sentiment-analysis-bert)! 
Couldn't train the model on my 8gb CPU due to its huge size. Just to warn ya that your system could hang.

Anyways, things you would get exposed to while doing this project are: (Basic Machine Learning knowledge is a prerequisite)
  - Pytorch
  - sklearn
  - Huggingface transformers library
